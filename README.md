make-readme
===========

Node module that creates a 'blank' readme.md file in the current folder.  Whenever I start a new project, I find myself manually creating a new readme.md file or copying one from another project. To simplify this process, I created this node module to automate creating a simple node module to do it for me. 

Installation
------------
To install the module, open a terminal window and execute the following command:

	npm install -g make-readme

Usage
------------
To use the module, open a terminal window, navigate to the folder where you want the file created then issue the following command:

	make-readme

That's it, it's that simple.

The module uses the current folder name as the title for the readme.md file it creates.
